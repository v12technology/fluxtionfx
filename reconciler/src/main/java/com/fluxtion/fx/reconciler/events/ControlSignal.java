/**
 * ControlSignal is an event that provides a generic method for nodes to receive
 * control signals without having to define bespoke control events for each type
 * of signal.
 *
 * The ControlSignal has a filter string, which allows the receiver to filter
 * which ControlSignals it should be informed of. A node marks a method with a
 * filtered EventHandler annotation to receive a control message:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * EventHandler(filterString = "filterString", propogate = false)
 * public void controlMethod(ControlSignal publishSignal){
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Using the propogate=false will prevent a control signal from starting an
 * event chain for any dependent nodes.
 *
 * The ControlSignal also provides an optional enable flag the
 * receiver can inspect.
